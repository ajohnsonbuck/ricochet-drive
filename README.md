# RicochetDrive

## Description
Embark on an interplanetary journey, piloting your starship across the solar system by synchronizing fuel pod activation to the pulse of an eclectic sci-fi soundtrack. Each pod must be primed with radiation of the proper polarity, achieved by skillfully reflecting laser beams off the correct panels.

Could this task be automated?  Of course... but under strict Federation anti-automation laws, at least 20% of all labor must be carried out by sentient biological beings. Thatâ€™s where you come in.

This immersive virtual reality experience was developed in Unreal Engine.
