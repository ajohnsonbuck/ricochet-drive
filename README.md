# RicochetDrive

## Description
Embark on an interstellar journey, piloting your starship across the solar system by synchronizing fuel pod activation to the pulse of an eclectic sci-fi soundtrack. Each pod must be energized with radiation of the proper polarity, achieved by skillfully reflecting laser beams off the correct panels.

Automation might make the task trivial—but under strict Federation anti-automation laws, at least 20% of all labor must be carried out by sentient biological beings. That’s where you come in.

This passion project was developed in Unreal Engine 5.6, blending rhythm, puzzle-solving, and immersive world-building into a unique interactive experience.
